## Chat with your database using Generative AI

This repository contains a Python script for interactive SQL query generation using OpenAI's GPT models and executing the generated queries on a PostgreSQL database using SQLDatabaseChain.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- `langchain`
- `environ`
- PostgreSQL (with appropriate credentials)
- OpenAI API key

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install langchain environ
```

### Configuration

Make sure to update the following information in the script:

- `API_KEY`: Provide your OpenAI API key.
- Database URI: Update the database URI to connect to your PostgreSQL database.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sql-query-generation.git
cd SQL-chatbot-Using-LLM
```

2. Update the script with your OpenAI API key and database URI.

3. Run the Python script `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Description

This script allows users to interactively input prompts/questions. The script then utilizes OpenAI's GPT model to generate syntactically correct PostgreSQL queries based on the input prompts. These generated queries are executed on a PostgreSQL database, and the results are displayed back to the user.

### Input

- User prompts/questions.

### Output

- Syntactically correct SQL queries generated by the GPT model.
- Results of executing the generated SQL queries on the PostgreSQL database.
